Hello, and welcome to OpenSource Philosophy! I am Vitus Sch√§fftlein, an undergraduate student with a deep-rooted passion for philosophy &amp;ndash; and an advocate of the idea that academia should be open source, not least because at the heart of both democratic societies and academia, there is freedom and knowledge, which are two concepts that cannot and must not be ripped apart.
As its name suggests, this blog features both of these topics &amp;ndash; philosophy and open source &amp;ndash;, and I have deliberately chosen it to allow divergent interpretations as to what it actually is about.</description></item></channel></rss>
