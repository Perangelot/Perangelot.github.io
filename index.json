Nonetheless, it depends on packages which are not natively available on Windows, so by default, quite some features of emacs available on Linux do not work for the Windows Version.\nThis should be one more reason [Link] for you to consider changing to an open-source operating system such as Linux. Please do not just gloss over this point. Next to security reasons, user-configurability and extendeability, there are compelling arguments \u0026ndash; both politcal and ethical \u0026ndash; why you should not support big-tech companies. Plus there is Tux, the mascot of Linux. And who does not want a penguin as their mascot?\nThat being said, some people depend on Windows if they like it or not (although many people only think this is the case, esepecially in academia [Link]), and if they want to use an open-source text editor instead of Word, this is a big plus already. So, let\u0026rsquo;s start building emacs from source!\n .ox-hugo-toc ul { list-style: none; }  Table of Contents  1 The Problem with emacs on Windows 2 The Solution to the Problem  2.1 installing msys2 2.2 configuring msys2   3 Preparing to install emacs  3.1 Installing build dependencies   4 Building emacs  4.1 Configuring the installation 4.2 building emacs 4.3 Setting the Paths   5 Setting up an emacs daemon 6 The Next Part of your Journey    2 The Solution to the Problem #  Since Windows is not capable of providing a satisfactory emacs experience but Linux is, we simply import all the necessary linux libraries to windows. There are many ways to achieve this, but the one preferred by me is using msys2. msys2 is an open-source software based on cygwin which does exactly what we need: Provide the necessary tools to build Linux software natively in Windows. So let\u0026rsquo;s install it!\n2.1 installing msys2 #  Visit the website of msys2 and download the latest windows installer. Double-click it and follow the steps of the installation wizard. I installed it to C:\\msys64.\nWarning: Do not open any other of the .exe files. Following the below steps with the wrong executable opened will cause problems.\n2.2 configuring msys2 #  Go to C:\\msys64\\home\\\u0026lt;user\u0026gt; and open .bash.rc with notepad by double-clicking on the file and, if necessary, selecting the notepad among the list of programs. Then, add the following code to the end of the file:\nif [ (uname -o) == \u0026#39;Msys\u0026#39; ]; then export PATH=`echo {PATH} | awk -v RS=: -v ORS=: \u0026#39;/c\\// {next} {print}\u0026#39; | sed \u0026#39;s/:*//\u0026#39;` fi This code snippet makes sure that issuing a command in msys2 which happens to have the same name as a windows command won\u0026rsquo;t cause problems. Lastly, we want to make sure that msys2 is recognized by Windows. We do that by setting a so-called PATH variable. With that, we just tell Windows to look for executables in that path. This way, we make sure that Windows finds msys2.\nTo do that, open the application launcher by pressing the Windows key, type in \u0026ldquo;environment variables\u0026rdquo; and click on the first result. If you have administrator rights, you can now click on \u0026ldquo;New\u0026rdquo; and add both the path to msys2 and its subfolder /bin. For me, this was C:\\msys64\\mingw64 and C:\\msys64\\mingw64\\bin. If you do not have admin rights, you can just add the paths to your current path(s) by separating them by semicolons as in C:\\msys64\\mingw64\\bin;C:\\msys64\\mingw64\\bin.\nAnd with that, msys2 is configured! You can now back to C:\\msys64 and open mingw64.exe. Press on \u0026ldquo;environment variables\u0026rdquo; again, select \u0026ldquo;path\u0026rdquo; and click on \u0026ldquo;edit\u0026rdquo;.\n3 Preparing to install emacs #  Now we have the means to get everything we need to build emacs, but have we not got anything yet. Thus, the next step is to do just that. Conveniently, msys2 also uses pacman, the package manager which by default ships with Arch Linux, so it might even be familiar to you.\n3.1 Installing build dependencies #  First of all, we want to make sure that our package manage is up-to-date:\npacman -Syu The flags S, y and u stand for \u0026ldquo;Sync\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;refresh\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;sysupdate\u0026rdquo;, respectively. That being done, we install all tools we need to build emacs from source, starting with the most important ones:\npacman -Sy pacman -Sy\\ \t--needed \\ \tfilesystem \\ \tmsys2-runtime \\ \tbash \\ \tlibreadline \\ \tlibiconv \\ \tlibarchive \\ \tlibgpgme \\ \tlibcurl \\ \tpacman \\ \tncurses \\ \tlibintl Now we\u0026rsquo;ll ned to update pacman again:\npacman -Su Finally, we will download and install the necessary libraries. Depending on your download speed and your hardware, this will take quite a while. Perfect time to rethink whether you really need Windows. Remember you can also have two systems installed on your machine [Link] to try out Linux!\npacman -Su \\ \tautoconf \\ \tautogen \\ \tautomake \\ \tautomake-wrapper \\ \tdiffutils \\ \tgit \\ \tguile \\ \tlibgc \\ \tlibguile \\ \tlibidn-devel \\ \tlibltdl \\ \tlibnettle-devel \\ \tlibopenssl \\ \tlibp11-kit-devel \\ \tlibtasn1-devel \\ \tlibunistring \\ \tmake \\ \tmingw-w64-x86_64-binutils \\ \tmingw-w64-x86_64-bzip2 \\ \tmingw-w64-x86_64-cairo \\ \tmingw-w64-x86_64-crt-git \\ \tmingw-w64-x86_64-dbus \\ \tmingw-w64-x86_64-expat \\ \tmingw-w64-x86_64-fontconfig \\ \tmingw-w64-x86_64-freetype \\ \tmingw-w64-x86_64-gcc \\ \tmingw-w64-x86_64-gcc-libs \\ \tmingw-w64-x86_64-gdk-pixbuf2 \\ \tmingw-w64-x86_64-gettext \\ \tmingw-w64-x86_64-giflib \\ \tmingw-w64-x86_64-glib2 \\ \tmingw-w64-x86_64-gmp \\ \tmingw-w64-x86_64-gnutls \\ \tmingw-w64-x86_64-harfbuzz \\ \tmingw-w64-x86_64-headers-git \\ \tmingw-w64-x86_64-imagemagick \\ \tmingw-w64-x86_64-isl \\ \tmingw-w64-x86_64-jansson \\ \tmingw-w64-x86_64-libffi \\ \tmingw-w64-x86_64-libgccjit \\ \tmingw-w64-x86_64-libiconv \\ \tmingw-w64-x86_64-libidn2 \\ \tmingw-w64-x86_64-libjpeg-turbo \\ \tmingw-w64-x86_64-libpng \\ \tmingw-w64-x86_64-librsvg \\ \tmingw-w64-x86_64-libsystre \\ \tmingw-w64-x86_64-libtasn1 \\ \tmingw-w64-x86_64-libtiff \\ \tmingw-w64-x86_64-libunistring \\ \tmingw-w64-x86_64-libwinpthread-git \\ \tmingw-w64-x86_64-libxml2 \\ \tmingw-w64-x86_64-mpc \\ \tmingw-w64-x86_64-mpfr \\ \tmingw-w64-x86_64-nettle \\ \tmingw-w64-x86_64-p11-kit \\ \tmingw-w64-x86_64-pango \\ \tmingw-w64-x86_64-pixman \\ \tmingw-w64-x86_64-poppler \\ \tmingw-w64-x86_64-winpthreads \\ \tmingw-w64-x86_64-xpm-nox \\ \tmingw-w64-x86_64-xz \\ \tmingw-w64-x86_64-zlib \\ \tmingw-w64-x86_64-jbigkit \\ \tnano \\ \topenssl \\ \tpkgconf \\ \ttar \\ \ttexinfo \\ \twget Having done this, we could in principle compile emacs from source. What we should not forget, though, is that emacs lives from packages \u0026ndash; and they also have dependencies which we need to install. Of course, then, the code below might not suffice to cover all dependencies your packages need. Nonetheless, it takes care of the most important ones: hunspell to make spell-checking work and poppler to allow pdf-tools to open .pdf files. sqlite already is installed with the binaries above, so org-roam (and also org-roam-ui) will work.\npacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-hunspell \\ \tmingw-w64-x86_64-poppler \\ \tmingw-w64-x86_64-poppler-data Note that whilst only an english dictionary is available via msys2, you can add dictionaries of any language you like by putting them in C:\\msys64\\mingw64\\share\\hunspell. For a list of dictionaries to download, visit this page. Of course, you will need to adjust the emacs code, too, then. But this is a topic for [Link] another post.\nFor those who want to use emacs as a LaTeX editor or like having their formulas overlayed with org-preview, you should also install the texlive binaries. This installation should happen without the help of msys2; if you already have a LaTeX distribution installed, emacs will recognize it once it is configured. If not, you need to install it. The easiest way I have found is to use an .iso image, but there are other possibilities as well.\nIf you think of using mu4e as your emacs client on Windows, this might be a problem because there is no msys2 package for mu. You might try your luck with an unofficial package, though.\n4 Building emacs #  Now we have done everything we need to start with the actual building process. First of all, we need to download the source code. We are doing this by cloning an official git repository:\ngit clone http://git.savannah.gnu.org/r/emacs.git 4.1 Configuring the installation #  Next up, we need to tell emacs what (not) to build. I have chosen to go with every sensible dependency to cover all needs:\nIf you get an error message, you are likely in the wrong folder. Make sure the folder contains autogen.sh. You can do that by running ls, which lists the contents of the folder the console currently operates in.\n4.2 building emacs #  Now, we\u0026rsquo;re finally ready to do the last step: Actually installing emacs! This will take at least 10 minutes, possibly up to 30. Just run the following code:\nmake make install 4.3 Setting the Paths #  With this, you have built your own emacs from source \u0026ndash; Congratulations! To run emacs, we still need to put two files in the binary folder: libdbus-1-3.dll and libgmp-10.dll. You can download them here and here, respectively. Just open the Windows explorer, type %APPDATA% in the folder bar and press Enter. You will now be in C:\\Users\\\u0026lt;user\u0026gt;\\AppData\\Roaming. Open the folder called bin and put the .dll file in there. If you now double-click und runemacs.exe, emacs should open.\n5 Setting up an emacs daemon #  Since emacs is not a Windows program, its performance on Windows is, to put it mildly, not out of this world. Especially if you have a large configuration file, it might take half a minute or even longer to get it started. This, of course, completely interferes with your workflow, so we\u0026rsquo;ll need to find a way to deal with that. And the way to go is as simple as silently starting emacs at startup and letting it pop up whenever we want to edit a file in it. This running-in-the-background service is called a server or a daemon.\nOn Linux, setting up a daemon is as simple as typing in a single command. On Windows, on the other hand, things aren\u0026rsquo;t as easy (as is often the case). To alleviate at least some of the despair, I have written some code which takes care of it and converted it to .exe files. Just download all the .exe files and put them in the folder in which the other emacs executables are. For me, it was C:\\Users\\Vitus\\AppData\\Roaming\\bin. Since this folder by default is in the Path variable, we can skip the first step of the instructions on the github page and only need to follow the other 8 steps described on github; this will approximately take 5 minutes. And that\u0026rsquo;s it. Now you have successfully installed the emacs daemon \u0026ndash; Congratulations!\n6 The Next Part of your Journey #  If you have followed this guide up until now, your emacs is ready to use, but it will look unfamiliar and the keybindings will be very different from Windows, so you are likely to be completely overwhelmed. This is normal, and I was, too. For this, reason, as a next step, you will need to set up a configuration file which will make your life easier. If you now feel even more overwhelmed, no worries, this [Link] post is for you. Should you already know how setting up such a file works and just want the familiar keybindings, you might want to check out [Link] this post.\nFor those die-hards who already know all this, just put your configuration file in the folder which in turn contains bin. For me, that was C:\\Users\\Vitus\\AppData\\Roaming. Note that, especially if you use the famous package-manager use-package, you might need to start it more than once to get every package installed.\n","date":"27 Jan. 2022","lastmod":"28 Jan. 2022","permalink":"https://Perangelot.github.io/posts/install-emacs-on-windows/","tags":["test","example","syntax highlighting"],"title":"Example Post"},{"categories":null,"contents":"test\n","date":"27 Jan. 2022","lastmod":"28 Jan. 2022","permalink":"https://Perangelot.github.io/posts/test2/","tags":["test","example","syntax highlighting"],"title":"Example Post"}]
