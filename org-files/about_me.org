Hello, and welcome to OpenSource Philosophy! I am Vitus Sch√§fftlein, an undergraduate student with a deep-rooted passion for philosophy -- and an advocate of the idea that academia should be open source, not least because at the heart of both democratic societies and academia, there is freedom and knowledge, which are two concepts that cannot and must not be ripped apart.

As its name suggests, this blog features both of these topics -- philosophy and open source --, and I have deliberately chosen it to allow divergent interpretations as to what it /actually/ is about. If you want to learn more about the that, feel free to look into this post. If you happen to be interested in who I am, what I do, why I do it and what I want to do in the future, you are invited to have a look at the About Me section. If you like what you see and you want to support me, this post is for you.
