Hello, and welcome to OpenSource Philosophy! I am Vitus Schäfftlein, an undergraduate student with a deep-rooted passion for philosophy &amp;ndash; and an advocate of the idea that academia should be open source, not least because at the heart of both democratic societies and academia, there is freedom and knowledge, which are two concepts that cannot and must not be ripped apart.

but it only works if we all pull together.
People who offer free and open source content put a lot of time and elbow grease into their projects because they are convinced that it is the right way to do it.</description></item><item><title>Example!</title><link>//Perangelot.github.io/posts/example/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//Perangelot.github.io/posts/example/</guid><description>
