Hello, and welcome to opensource-philosophy! My name is Vitus
Schäfftlein and I am a student of philosophy working as an assistant
for Professor Niko Strobach at the WWU Münster, Germany. I have quite
some topics up my sleeve that I would like to write about before
making this blog public, but you can be sure you'll get to read some
interesting content soon!
